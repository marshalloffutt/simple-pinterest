# Simple Pinterest

## Description
This was an in-class code along exercise where we begin to use multiple sets of data (boards, and pins), and uses Promises to get and set data from locally hosted JSON files. When the page loads, the user is able to see boards for categories. When the user clicks the board, they are able to see pinned items on that board.

### How to Run 
```
1. Go to: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server` and install "http-server".  
2. Navigate to the project folder in command line interface and type: `http-server -p 8080`  
3. This will show at: `http://localhost:8080` in your internet browser.  
```
